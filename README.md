An Enigma machine emulator

This script emulates the function of many different Enigma machines from WWII.
This script is a proof of concept for myself. I merely wanted to see if I could do it,
as well as give people a quick and easy way to encipher / decipher anything they wanted
and also retain the original spaces and punctuation, which is not allowed in other
Enigma emulators.


##### TODO:
- Make the enigma selector disable the unused select boxes and options
- Test that everything works as expected.
